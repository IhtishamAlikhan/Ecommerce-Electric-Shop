# Ecommerce-Electric-Shop
**An **electrical store** is a shop focused on selling different **electrical supplies **(cable, cable channels, electric sockets etc.) and electrical devices (electric meters, junction boxes, fuse boxes etc.).**
you mighy be wondering that it's an ecommerce shop which basicaly sell products likes clothes, watches, t-shirts, etc. but let me clear this confusion that it is basically an ecommerce website but the idea is change here i have add products about electric related like bulbs, switches, wires, etc. you can find all these in the directory folder.

**How to import this file into your system**

Well it so easy you may have xxamp or wamp installed in your system right! then it is so easy now simple download the code and paste it in your xxamp or wamp directory.
The next step is you need to create a database in your server whatever name you choose just make a database and import the db file in your database. I'm sure you may be aware from this.
Now the next part is go to the search result and type localhost/ses you will see your website will be open.
